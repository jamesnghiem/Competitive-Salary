# Competitive-Salary
Gamified Multi-User Personal Finance iOS App Prototype - Intuit Hack-Into-It 2017 

Competitive-Salary is a rough prototype of a gamification of personal finance app that allows multiple users to compete with one another to minimize weekly spending in an attempt to increase financial literacy. App was created in under 16 hours with Evan Chang (https://www.github.com/pkmnfreak) and Jason Yeung. 

Each user's purchases were categorized into 3 different categories (Food, Transportation, Recreation) and stored in a Firebase DB with respect to each user. Purchases were also associated with strings describing purchase type (e.g. "Uber ride to 24th Mission:$15.50", "In-N-Out Double-Double:$3.65").
